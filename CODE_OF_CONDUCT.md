# Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

We want Pokémon Stats to be a chill, collaborative, and respectful space for everyone.

As contributors and maintainers, we pledge to make participation in our project and community a harassment-free
experience for everyone, regardless of level of experience, background, or identity.

We’re here because we love building cool tools, learning from each other, and maybe geeking out over Pokémon stats along
the way.

## Our Standards

Examples of behavior that helps create a positive environment include:

- Being respectful and considerate in communication and reviews
- Offering constructive feedback, not personal attacks
- Being open to alternative approaches and perspectives
- Acknowledging the work and effort of others

Examples of unacceptable behavior include:

- Using sexualized language or imagery
- Trolling, insulting, or derogatory comments
- Harassment or threats, in public or private
- Publishing others’ private information (like real names or contact info) without permission

## Our Responsibilities

Maintainers are responsible for clarifying and enforcing standards of acceptable behavior and may take appropriate
action in response to any behavior they deem inappropriate, threatening, or harmful.

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies both within project spaces and in public spaces when someone is representing the project or
its community.

## Enforcement

Instances of abusive, harassing, or otherwise unacceptable behavior may be reported by opening an issue or contacting
the maintainer directly at:

**[juanda.martinezn@gmail.com](mailto:juanda.martinezn@gmail.com)**

All reports will be handled with discretion.

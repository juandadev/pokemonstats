## 🌟 Why This Project Exists

As a lifelong Pokémon fan and frontend developer, I got tired of jumping between wikis, PDFs, and forums just to check
something as simple as a type matchup or evolution path. I wanted a tool that gave me exactly what I needed: fast,
clean, and focused, especially while playing.

That’s how Pokémon Stats was born. Originally, it was just a personal tool I built for myself, with no fancy UI or
intentions of sharing it. But as I replayed older games, I realized others might be dealing with the same annoyances. So
I decided to redesign it (WIP), improve the UX, and open source it for anyone who finds it useful.

This project reflects my passion for games, clean interfaces, and solving small real world annoyances with code.
